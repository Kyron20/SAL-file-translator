Show you some example SAL files you can use to test my program. Please note it isn't perfect and only works for majority but not all cases. I added some attached png to show you how it translates text.


Image 1 shows the Languages instructions, format and operations meaning.
Image 2 shows the insturction and the encoded result (what my program should output in these cases).
Image 3 is just an example file of how a complete SAL file would look like. My code should be able to translate all of that into either 16 bit instructions at most for each line read.
